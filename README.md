I developed a travel planner AI. I used Javascript (React, Typescript), Tailwind (components are from DaisyUI), and NodeJs (Express). 
The travel itinerary is generated by ChatGPT, images are obtained from Pexels, and the map is from the Leaflet library.

The server is hosted on the railways.app website, so it may sometimes run slower. Although the ChatGPT response is 
requested to be in a predefined format (function), there may be occasional issues with loading the response, resulting in an error. 
In such cases, it is necessary to retry the search. Also, sometimes the maps in Leaflet load very slowly, especially the map edges.
