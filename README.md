I've created an AI travel planner. I used Javascript (React, Typescript), Tailwind (components are from DaisyUI) and NodeJs (Express). 
The travel itinerary is generated by ChatGPT, images are obtained from Pexels, and the map is from the Leaflet library.

The server is hosted on the railways.app website, so it may sometimes run slower. 

Sometimes AI provides responses in the wrong format or with illogical details (for example, destination names are called "day 1," or coordinates are not numerical). In that case, the process of sending a request to AI is automatically repeated.
Also, sometimes the maps in Leaflet load very slowly, especially the map edges.
